#in tuple everithing will be same just no chznges can bedomne in the value,four collection data types in the Python programming language:List is a collection which is ordered and changeable. Allows duplicate members.
#Tuple is a collection which is ordered and unchangeable. Allows duplicate members.
#Set is a collection which is unordered and unindexed. No duplicate members.
#Dictionary is a collection which is unordered, changeable and indexed. No duplicate members.
#n Python tuples are written with round brackets.list in the sql]r bracket,In Python sets are written with curly brackets.In Python dictionaries are written with curly brackets, and they have keys and values.

#The elif keyword is pythons way of saying "if the previous conditions were not true, then try this condition".
#print("A") if 2 > 3 else print("B") even this is the method for executing if ..else if 2<3 and 3<4 : print...this way and or can be used.

  #break means come out of the main loop but in case of continue it will stop the curent iteration and start with the new iteration.

#To loop through a set of code a specified number of times, we can use the range() function,even we can use range(2,6) here increament will be dafaultone that is one,range(2,9,3) here increament will be 3...
#for x in range(6):
